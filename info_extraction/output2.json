      "use": "Pantoprazole is used to treat certain stomach and esophagus problems (such as acid reflux). It works by decreasing the amount of acid your stomach makes. This medication relieves symptoms such as heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and persistent cough. It helps heal acid damage to the stomach and esophagus, helps prevent ulcers, and may help prevent cancer of the esophagus. Pantoprazole belongs to a class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).\n",
      "how": "Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking pantoprazole and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\nTake this medication by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually once daily. Dosage and length of treatment are based on your medical condition and response to treatment.\nIf you are taking the tablets, you may take them with or without food. Swallow the tablets whole. Do not split, crush, or chew the medication. Doing so may destroy the drug.\nIf you are taking the granules, take your dose 30 minutes before a meal. To take it by mouth, open the packet and mix the granules in applesauce or apple juice. Do not mix with other foods or liquids. Do not crush or chew the granules. Sprinkle the granules on 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of applesauce and swallow all of the mixture right away (within 10 minutes). Follow with sips of water. Or you can mix the granules with 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of apple juice in a small cup, stir for 5 seconds, and swallow all of the mixture right away. To make sure you take the entire dose, rinse the cup once or twice with apple juice to mix any remaining granules, and swallow the juice. Do not prepare the mixture ahead of time for later use.\nIf you are giving the granules through a tube into the stomach (nasogastric or gastric tube), ask your health care professional for detailed instructions on how to properly mix and give it.\nIf needed, antacids may be taken along with this medication. If you are also taking sucralfate, take pantoprazole at least 30 minutes before sucralfate.\nUse this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, take it at the same time each day. Continue to take this medication for the prescribed length of treatment even if you are feeling better.\nTell your doctor if your condition persists or worsens. The risk of side effects goes up over time. Ask your doctor how long you should take this medication.\n"

Tell your doctor right away if you develop symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency (such as unusual weakness, sore tongue, or numbness/tingling of the hands/feet).\nA very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing, signs of kidney problems (such as change in the amount of urine).\nThis is not a complete list of possible side effects.
